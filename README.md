# Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer Interview Questions
- 💡 This [repository](https://github.com/badiaamakhlouf/data_science_interview_preparation), serves as an invaluable resource for those preparing for technical interviews in Data Science and Machine Learning.

- 🤝 My commitment to excellence doesn't stop here—I aspire to continually enhance this repository by incorporating the latest technologies and advancements in data science and machine learning.

- 📋 It is organized into big two main topics, data science and machine learning where subject or topic is splitted into smaller modules. 

## 1- 📊 Data science 
Regardless of your career level—whether you're a junior, mid-level, senior, or lead—there are essential technical concepts and skills that every individual should master before embarking on a data science interview.
Certainly, there are certain data science skills that are exclusively required for senior or lead positions. Here, I provide you with a comprehensive list tailored to different proficiency levels:

- 📌 [Probability and Statistics](pages/statistics_and_probability.md):
    - It is required to master and understand fundamental statistical concepts such as mean, standard deviation, variance etc.
    - In addition, probability distributions, Central Limit Theorem, Bayes’ Theorem and confidence intervals.
  
- 📌 [Programming Proficiency](pages/programming_proficiency.md):
    - The primary programming languages used in the data science field are Python and R.
    - The choice between the two depends on various factors. For instance, if you're dealing with intricate data requiring extensive statistical computations and superior data visualization capabilities, R is often preferred. On the other hand, Python is better suited for a wide range of data science tasks, including machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence applications.
    - Finally, the decision is based on the specific requirements of your project and your familiarity with each language's ecosystem.
  
- 📌 [Data Cleaning and Preprocessing](pages/data_cleaning_and_preprocessing.md):
    - This step involves mastering the handling of missing data (null values), encoding categorical variables, handling outliers, and executing various data manipulation tasks.
    - This step is essential for extracting accurate insights from the provided data. Successfully completing these cleaning and preprocessing steps is crucial for subsequent stages, such as feature engineering and extraction, where refined features are created to enhance model performance.

- 📌 [Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](pages/data_visualization.md):
    - Effective visualizations are crucial for understanding data accurately and making informed assumptions.
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves obtaining summary statistics with Pandas, examining variable distributions using distribution plots and boxplots, exploring relationships between features with correlation matrices and scatter plots, identifying outliers, and more.
    - All of these techniques are invaluable for clearly communicating insights and findings.
  
- 📌 [Feature Engineering and Feature Extraction](pages/feature_engineering.md):
    - This step involves identifying and extracting relevant features from raw data or transforming existing ones. As mentioned earlier, feature engineering and extraction are crucial tasks for enhancing model performance and obtaining meaningful insights.
        
- 📌 [Machine Learning Fundamentals](pages/machine_learning_fundamentals.md):
    - Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on creating algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions.
    - It's essential to understand fundamentals in ML algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised learning methods, and master model evaluation techniques.
    - These skills will be expanded more upon in the advanced ML and MLOps topic in the second section.
  
- 📌 [SQL Skills](pages/sql_skills_for_data_science):
    - Every data scientist should master SQL to access and manipulate data effectively, including tasks like aggregation, filtering, and sorting.
    - SQL remains the cornerstone language or the most important language for data work, making proficiency in it essential for success in the field.
  
- 📌 [Experimental Design](pages/experimental_design.md):
    - It is fundamental for optimizing solutions to complex problems.
    - It covers various aspects such as finding the most effective data acquisition methods, testing hypotheses, and validating assumptions through techniques like A/B testing.
  
- 📌 [Big Data Technologies](pages/big_data_technologies.md):
    - Indeed, big data shares many similarities with data science.
    - The primary distinction lies in the scale of data involved. In big data, we handle vast volumes of data, necessitating specialized skills and technologies from both data engineering and data science domains.
    - Proficiency in tools like Hadoop, Spark, or Hive is particularly advantageous for this area, especially, for senior positions.
      
- 📌 [General Concepts](pages/ds_general.md):
    - In this section, I aim to tackle common questions in the field of data science, covering fundamental concepts like the definition of data science, computer vision, natural language processing, and more.
    - By exploring these topics, you'll gain insights into various aspects of data science and AI, enhancing your understanding of these interconnected fields.
