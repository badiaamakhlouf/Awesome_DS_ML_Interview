# Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer Interview Questions
I'm excited to introduce this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/badiaamakhlouf/data_science_interview_preparation), 
which contains a comprehensive collection of diverse questions covering various aspects of data science and machine learning. 
This repository serves as an invaluable resource for those preparing for technical interviews in these fields.
I've put significant effort into curating a wide range of questions, ensuring they encompass both fundamental principles and project-related inquiries.

My commitment to excellence doesn't stop hereâ€”I aspire to continually enhance this repository by incorporating the latest technologies and advancements in data science and machine learning.

**Note:** please, your feedback is highly valued, so please feel free to share any suggestions or comments for improvement.
Together, let's foster a collaborative space for learning and growth in the dynamic realm of data science and machine learning.

This repository is organized into subjects and their corresponding modules. 
Primarily, we feature two main subjects: data science and machine learning. 
Each subject comprises a set of modules that zero in on specific areas within data or machine learning. 
Consequently, the repository contains a comprehensive collection of questions tailored to each module, offering a targeted resource for in-depth exploration of related topics.
## 1- Data science 
Regardless of your level (junior, senior, or lead), there are fundamental concepts and skills that individuals should master before going into a data science interview.
Here's a comprehensive list that spans different levels:

- [Statistics and Probability](pages/statistics_and_probability.md): understand fundamental statistical concepts, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and probability distributions.
- [Programming Proficiency](pages/programming_proficiency.md): master a programming language commonly used in data science, such as Python or R, and be comfortable with data manipulation libraries like Pandas and NumPy
- [Data Cleaning and Preprocessing](pages/data_cleaning_and_preprocessing.md): master how to handle missing data, outliers, and perform preprocessing tasks to prepare data for analysis and modeling
- [Feature Engineering](pages/feature_engineering.md): understand the importance of feature engineering and how to create relevant features to improve model performance.
- [Data Visualization](pages/data_visualization.md): create effective visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to communicate insights and findings clearly.
- [Machine Learning Fundamentals](): gain a solid understanding of fundamental machine learning algorithms, encompassing both supervised and unsupervised learning. Develop expertise in model evaluation techniques and the adeptness to select the most suitable algorithm for diverse scenarios. This proficiency will be further detailed in the second subject, which delves into Machine Learning and MLOPS
- [SQL Skills](pages/sql_skills_for_data_science): be proficient in SQL for querying databases and extracting relevant information
- [Experimental Design](pages/experimental_design.md): understand how to design experiments and A/B tests to draw meaningful conclusions from data.
- [Big Data Technologies](pages/big_data_technologies.md): familiarity with big data tools and technologies, such as Hadoop, Spark, or Hive, can be beneficial for more senior roles.

**Note:** remember that preparation is key, and practical hands-on experience with real-world datasets can significantly enhance your confidence and proficiency in these fundamental areas.
Additionally, staying updated on industry trends and advancements is essential to showcase a proactive attitude during interviews. 
Please, do not forget to tailor your preparation to the specific requirements outlined in the job description
