    "### 0- What does regression analysis mean?\n",
    "- Regression analysis is a statistical technique used in data science and statistics to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.\n",
    "- The primary goal of regression analysis is to understand the nature and strength of the relationship between variables and to make predictions based on that understanding.\n",
    "- It helps answering questions such as:\n",
    "    - How does a change in one variable (independent variable) impact another variable (dependent variable)?\n",
    "    - Can we predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of one or more independent variables?\n",
    "- Resgression formula: $Y=W \\times X + b$\n",
    "- Where : \n",
    "    - Y: dependent variable (response variable): the variable that we want to predict or explain.\n",
    "    - X: independent variable(s) (predictor variable(s)): the variable(s) used to predict or explain the variability in the dependent variable.\n",
    "    - W: regression coefficients: these are the parameters in the regression equation that indicate the strength and direction of the relationship between variables.\n",
    "    - b:bias term \n",
    "- Residuals: \n",
    "    - Differences between the observed (y(n)) and predicted values ($y\\hat(n)$), representing the model's error.\n",
