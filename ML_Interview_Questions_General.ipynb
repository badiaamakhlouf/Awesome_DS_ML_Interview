    "    - **Training phase:** after splitting the data into training and testing sets, training data is used to train our model on a labeled dataset. During the training phase, the model tries to learn relationships between input data and the corresponding output target values while adjusting its internal parameters. Throughout this phase, the model aims to maximise the accuracy of making precise predictions or classifications when exposed to unseen data.\n",
    "    - **Validation phase:** after the model is well trained, we evaluate it on a seperate dataset known as the validation set (maximum 10% of our data). This dataset is not used during the training process. Validation stage helps identify the existence of certain overfitting (model performing well on training data but poorly on new data) or certain underfitting (model needs more training to capture the underlying patterns in the data).\n",
    "    - **Testing (Inference) phase:** during this phase, the trained and validated model is applied to unseen dataset, called test dataset. This phase aims to evaluate the model's performance and provides a measure regarding the model's effectiveness and its ability to make accurate predictions in a production environment.\n",

    "- In case of imbalanced datasets, this technique is prefered because some classes may be underrepresented.\n",
    "- It helps in addressing issues related to  overrepresented or underrepresented classes in specific folds, which could lead to biased model evaluations.\n",
    "- Here are the main steps for Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation :\n",
    "    - Data Splitting : ensuring that each fold has an equal distribution for each class samples.\n",

    "- The testing set is called Holdout Set also and it helps gathering an initial estimate of a model's performance.\n",

    "- This technique is suitable if the input dataset is large enough to provide sufficient data for both training and testing, and when computational resources are limited compared to more computationally intensive methods like cross-validation.\n",
    "- This technique could be not too reliable as the model performance can be influenced by the specific random split of data into training and testing sets. \n",
