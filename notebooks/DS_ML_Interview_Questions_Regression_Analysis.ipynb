    "### Q57- What does Bayesian Regression mean? \n",

    "### Q58- How Bayesian Regression works?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Starting with **Prior Distribution** that respresents uncertainty about the coefficients before observing any data and it reflects any prior knowledge or beliefs about the coefficients. \n",
    "- The **likelihood** function represents the connection between the predictor variables and the response variable, expressing the probability of observing the data given the model parameters.\n",
    "- The prior distribution is updated with the observed data and using Bayes’ theorem to obtain the **posterior distribution** of the coefficients and estimate the likelihood of a set of parameters given observed data. \n",
    "- Parameter Estimation, which involves deriving the most likely values for the coefficients along with their uncertainties from the posterior distribution.\n",
    "- BR uses the posterior distribution of coefficients to make predictions. \n",
    "- Predictions are made by averaging over the predictions from all possible parameter values weighted by their posterior probabilities.\n",

    "**Notes:**\n",
    "- Traditional linear regression assumes Gaussian or normal distribution for data.\n",
    "- Bayesian regression imposes stronger assumptions and prior distributions on parameters.\n",

    "- **Low Training and Test Accuracy:** If both the training and test accuracies are low, it suggests that the model is not capturing the underlying patterns in the data, indicating underfitting.\n",
    "- **High Bias, Low Variance:** Underfit models typically have high bias and low variance, meaning they make simplistic assumptions about the data and are unable to capture its complexity.\n",
    "- **Poor Performance on Training Data:** If the model performs poorly on the training data, failing to fit even the basic patterns, it is likely underfitting.\n",
    "- **Simple Model with Few Parameters:** Models that are too simplistic or have too few parameters may underfit the data, as they cannot capture its underlying structure.\n",
