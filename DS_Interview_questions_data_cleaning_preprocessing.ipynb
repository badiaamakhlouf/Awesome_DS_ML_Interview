    "The normal distribution is very useful in machine learning becasue it has deterministic statistical characteristics  and it helps detect linear relationship between variables. It consists that mode=mean=median: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean: called also average of a data set and it is found by summing all numbers in the data set and then dividing by the number of values in the set.\n",
    "- Mode : it is the value that appears most often in a set of data values.\n",
    "- Median : the middle number; found by ordering all data points and picking out the one in the middle (or if there are two middle numbers, taking the mean of those two numbers)."

    "### Polynomial transformation \n",
    "if X is one input feature ==> X^2 is its polynomial feature. This process can be repeated for each input variable in the dataset, creating a transformed version of each.The “degree” of the polynomial is used to control the number of features added, e.g. a degree of 3 will add two new variables for each input variable. Typically a small degree is used such as 2 or 3. Choosing the best polynomial degree is so important as it impacts the number of input features created. \n",
    "\n",
    "Squaring or cubing an input variable changes its probability distribution, creating a distinction between small and large values. This distinction is amplified with a higher exponent. Such transformations are often beneficial for machine learning algorithms, particularly in tasks involving numerical input variables, improving predictive accuracy, especially in regression tasks.\n"
