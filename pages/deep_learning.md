## List of Questions
## Part 1: Deep Learning and Neural Networks
### Q0 -What is Deep Learning?

- It is a subset of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). 
- It is used to model complex patterns and representations.
- DL models are trained using large amounts of data.
- The term "deep" refers to the depth of the neural network, which consists of multiple hidden layers through which data is processed.
- It eliminates the need for manual feature engineering by automatically learning hierarchical representations from raw data during the training process.

    
### Q1- What are some real-life applications of deep learning algorithms?
- DL is used in various real-life scenarios across different fields.
