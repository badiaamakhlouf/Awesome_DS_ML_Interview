# ML : Supervised Learning

Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into different types based on their learning approaches, data characteristics, and task objectives. Supervised learning is one such type, where the model learns patterns from labeled data. In supervised learning, the input data is divided into features (input) and target (output). The goal is to predict the target or output using the provided features.

Supervised learning encompasses two main techniques:
   - Classification
   - Regression

This GitHub page provides essential information and detailed insights into each technique, offering comprehensive and tailored questions for technical interviews for data scientists and machine learning engineers. It can help you master everything about classification and regression, ensuring you're well-prepared to pass your technical interview.

## List of Questions

### Q0- What does regression analysis mean?

- It is a statistical technique used in data science and machine learning fields.
- It aims to model the relationship between a dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (x).
- Modeling the relationship between inputs and output helps understand the relationship nature and strength.
- In addition,  it help making the correct predictions based on that understanding.
- Mainly, we use regression analysis to resolve problems and answer questions such as:
    - How does a change in one variable (independent variable) impact another variable (dependent variable)?
    - Can we predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of one or more independent variables?
- It is widely used in various fields:
    - Economics
    - Finance
    - Biology
    - Psychology
    - Machine learning
