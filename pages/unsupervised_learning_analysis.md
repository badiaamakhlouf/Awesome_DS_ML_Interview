# ML : Unsupervised learning 

Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into different types based on their learning approaches, data characteristics, and task objectives. Unsupervised learning is one such type where the models are trained on unlabeled data to uncover hidden patterns or structures without explicit guidance. It's about finding relationships or structures within data without predefined outcomes or target variables.

💡 Unsupervised learning encompasses two main techniques:
   - Clustering
   - Associations

🧠 This GitHub page provides essential information and detailed insights into each technique, offering comprehensive and tailored questions for technical interviews for data scientists and machine learning engineers. It can help you master everything about Clsutering and associations, ensuring you're well-prepared to pass your technical interview.
