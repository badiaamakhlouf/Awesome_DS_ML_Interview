    "The data science life cycle is a systematic and iterative process that data scientists follow to extract meaningful insights from data and solve real-world problems. It typically includes the following key stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. Problem Definition : Objective and scope definition \n",
    "- 2. Data Collection :  identify data sources + data extraction \n",
    "- 3. Data Cleaning and Preparation : cleaning + transformation (NaN +Categorical)\n",
    "- 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : statistical analysis + visual exploration\n",
    "- 5. Feature Engineering : variable selection +transformation (log, normalization)\n",
    "- 6. Modeling : model selection + training + validation \n",
    "- 7. Evaluation : model evaluation + iterative improvement \n",
    "- 8. Deployment : integration + monitoring \n",
    "- 9. Communication : results interpretation + documentation\n",
    "- 10. Feedback and Iteration : feedback incorporation + iterative refinement\n",

    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit programming. The core idea behind machine learning is to allow machines to learn patterns, make predictions, or optimize decisions based on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts in machine learning include:\n",
    "- Types of Machine Learning: supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised\n",
    "- Split data into Training, validation and testing sets (case of supervised)\n",

    "\n",
    "Various data structures are used to organize and store data efficiently in DS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some commonly used data structures: Lists, Arrays, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries, DataFrames, Series, Graphs, Matrices, Sparse Data Structures, Queues, Stacks\n",
    "- **Lists:** A collection of elements, ordered and mutable.\n",
    "- **Arrays:** Similar to lists, but more efficient for numerical operations (used by numpy).\n",
    "- **Tuples:** Similar to lists but immutable (cannot be modified after creation).\n",
    "- **Sets:** An unordered collection of unique elements. Useful for eliminating duplicate values.\n",
    "- **Dictionaries:** A collection of key-value pairs. Efficient for retrieving values based on keys.\n",
    "- **DataFrames:** A two-dimensional labeled data structure. Found in libraries like Pandas, commonly used for working with structured data.\n",
    "- **Series:** A one-dimensional labeled array. Also found in Pandas, often used for time-series data.\n",
    "- **Graphs:** Represented as nodes and edges. Used for modeling relationships between entities.\n",
    "- **Matrices:** Two-dimensional arrays with rows and columns. Frequently used in linear algebra and numerical computing.\n",
    "- **Sparse Data Structures:** Specifically designed for datasets with a large number of zero or missing values. (Sparse matrices)\n",
    "- **Queues:** Follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Useful for implementing algorithms.\n",
    "- **Stacks:** Follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Used in algorithms where items are processed in a reverse order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of data structure depends on the nature of the data, the operations you need to perform, and the specific requirements of the task or algorithm. Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and networkx in Python provide powerful tools for working with these data structures in a data science context."
