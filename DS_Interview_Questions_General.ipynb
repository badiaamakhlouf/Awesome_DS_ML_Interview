    "- Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that utilizes scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract meaningful insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It combines expertise from various domains such as statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge to analyze and interpret complex datasets.\n",
    "- Data Science is a process of using data or studying data to understand various real world probelms and extract meaningful insights. Then using storytelling and present these insights to stakeholders and finally, help them make strategic decisions for the company.\n",
    "- Data science is the art of uncovering the insights and trends that are hiding behind data.\n",
    "- Data Science involves data and some science. The definition or the name came up in the 80s and 90s when some professors were looking into the statistics curriculum, and they thought it would be better to call it data science.\n",
    "- Data Science is the Science of working with data, to find answers coming from different departments such as sales, marketing, customer success etc. It's more about data than it is about science. \n",
    " \n",
    "- Nowadays, data is the new oil of the digital economy as we have tons of data available coming from various sources: \n",
    "    - Data is structured, unstructured and semi-structured\n",
    "    - Sources: log files, email, social media, sales data, patient information files, sports performance data, sensor data, security cameras, and many more besides.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data science becomes too available as cloud services are less expensive.\n",
    "- Cloud provides such as AWS, GCP and Azure help provide the computing power needed to make a useful analysis and reveal new knowledge.\n",

    "    - Where will that data come from? (various sources)\n",
    "- Depending on the nature of the problem, they can choose to analyze the data in different ways and using multiple models to explore the data, determine patterns and outliers.\n",
    "- Sometimes, data scientist findings may confirm the organization suspects and sometimes it will be lead to a complete new knowledge and a new approach. \n",
    "- After finding the corresponding insights, a data scientist must be a good storyteller (the ability to tell a story) to communicate the results to project stakeholder in an effective manner.\n",
    "- To accomplish this task, there is a plenty of visualisation tools that helps a data scientist present the found insights successfully and the recommended action to take. \n",
    "- A data scientist must be curious, extremely argumentative and judgmental.\n",
    "    - If you're not curious, you would not know what to do with the data.\n",
    "    - Judgmental because if you do not have preconceived notions about things you wouldn't know where to begin with.\n",
    "    - Argumentative because if you can argument and if you can plead a case, at least you can start somewhere and then you learn from data and then you modify your assumptions and hypotheses and your data would help you learn(starting from wrong point to find the right way)."
